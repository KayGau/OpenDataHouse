 AbstractSoftware visualization is a popular program comprehension 
technique used in the context of software maintenance, reverse 
engineering, and software evolution analysis. While there is a broad 
range of software visualization approaches, only few have been 
empirically evaluated. This is detrimental to the acceptance of software
 visualization in both the academic and the industrial world. We present
 a controlled experiment for the empirical evaluation of a 3D software 
visualization approach based on a city metaphor and implemented in a 
tool called CodeCity. The goal is to provide experimental evidence of 
the viability of our approach in the context of program comprehension by
 having subjects perform tasks related to program comprehension. We 
designed our experiment based on lessons extracted from the current body
 of research. We conducted the experiment in four locations across three
 countries, involving 41 participants from both academia and industry. 
The experiment shows that CodeCity leads to a statistically significant 
increase in terms of task correctness and decrease in task completion 
time. We detail the experiment we performed, discuss its results and 
reflect on the many lessons learned.

communication, synchronization}, }About the DataThe authors obtained 
data for 31 OSS projects from the Apache Software Foundation on March 
24th, 2012. For each project, the commit activities of developers on 
dierent files are gathered from the corresponding Git repository while 
the email communication activities are gathered from the online 
developer mailing lists. For each commit activity, The authors recorded 
the developer ID, file ID, file type, the exact submitting time in 
seconds, and the numbers of added and deleted LOC in each file. For each
 communication activity, The authors recorded the sender ID, receiver 
ID, and the sending time in seconds. Note that, developers may have 
multiple aliases, which were resolved by using a semi-automatic 
approach.AbstractIn distributed software development synchronized 
actions are important for completion of complex, interleaved tasks that 
require the abilities of multiple people. Synchronous development is 
manifested when le commits by two developers are close together in time 
and modify the same files. Here we propose quantitative methods for 
identifying synchronized activities in OSS projects, and use them to 
relate developer synchronization with effective productivity and 
communication. In particular, we dene co-commit bursts and communication
 bursts, as intervals of time rich in co-commit and correspondence 
activities, respectively, and construct from them smoothed time series 
which can be, subsequently, correlated to discover synchrony. We found 
that synchronized co-commits between developers are associated with 
their effective productivity and coordination: during co-commit bursts, 
vs. at other times, the project size grows faster even though the 
overall coding effort slows down. We also found strong correlation 
between synchronized co-commits and communication, that is, for pairs of
 developers,more co-commit bursts are accompanied with more 
communication bursts, and their relationship follows closely a linear 
model. In addition, synchronized co-commits and communication activities
 occur very close together in time, thus, they can also be thought of as
 synchronizing each other. This study can help with better understanding
 collaborative mechanisms in OSS and the role communication plays in 
distributed software engineering.

suite for Java concurrency bugs. The initial version of JaConTeBe 
contains 47 confirmed, real-world concurrency bugs from 8. open-source 
projects. JaConTeBe is an ongoing work and the authors plan to collect 
more bugs in the future.Paper AbstractResearchers have proposed various 
approaches to detect concurrency bugs and improve multi-threaded 
programs, but performing evaluations of the effectiveness of these 
approaches still remains a substantial challenge. We survey the existing
 evaluations and find out that they often use code or bugs not 
representative of real world. To improve representativeness, we have 
prepared JaConTeBe, a benchmark suite of 47 confirmed concurrency bugs 
from 8 popular open-source projects, supplemented with test cases for 
reproducing buggy behaviors. Running three approaches on JaConTeBe shows
 that our benchmark suite confirms some limitations of the three 
approaches. We submitted JaConTeBe to the SIR repository /(a 
software-artifact repository for rigorous controlled experiments/), and 
it was included as a part of SIR.

{10.1109//ASE.2011.6100076},}AbstractOne common task of developing or 
maintaining software is searching the source code for information like 
specific method calls or write accesses to certain fields. This kind of 
information is required to correctly implement new features and to solve
 bugs. For this, development environments offer search tool that are 
based on many radio-buttons and check-boxes. This paper presents an 
approach for querying source code with natural language. It enables the 
developer to execute a huge range of precise searches while being as 
easy and intuitive to use as writing natural language. The evaluation 
shows that the prototype implementation, integrated with the Eclipse 
development environment for Java, supports a wide range of queries and 
is able to correctly understand most real developer queries.Replication

 with more detailed information than the above spreadsheet/(detailed

associatedâ, âstatus of commitâ and âfiles committedâ.The xml contains 
the above information and additionally the lines associated with the 
commit.Paper AbstractBug localization refers to the automated process of
 locating the potential buggy files for a given bug report. To help 
developers focus their attention to those files is crucial. Several 
existing automated approaches for bug localization from a bug report 
face a key challenge, called lexical mismatch, in which the terms used 
in bug reports to describe a bug are different from the terms and code 
tokens used in source files. This paper presents a novel approach that 
uses deep neural network /(DNN/) in combination with rVSM, an 
information retrieval /(IR/) technique. rVSM collects the feature on the
 textual similarity between bug reports and source files. DNN is used to
 learn to relate the terms in bug reports to potentially different code 
tokens and terms in source files and documentation if they appear 
frequently enough in the pairs of reports and buggy files. Our empirical
 evaluation on real-world projects shows that DNN and IR complement well
 to each other to achieve higher bug localization accuracy than 
individual models. Importantly, our new model, HyLoc, with a combination
 of the features built from DNN, rVSM, and projectâs bug-fixing history,
 achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art IR and machine 
learning techniques. In half of the cases, it is correct with just a 
single suggested file. Two out of three cases, a correct buggy file is 
in the list of three suggested files.

                Data set for the paper Predicting Relevance of Change 
Recommendations by Thomas Rolfsnes, Leon Moonen, and 
David/&nbsp;Binkley, In International Conference on Automated Software 
Engineering /(ASE/),/&nbsp;pp. 694/â705. 2017, IEEE.Please cite this

preprint is included in this package/).Abstract: Software change 
recommendation seeks to suggest artifacts /(e.g., files or methods/) 
that are related to changes made by a developer, and thus identifies 
possible omissions or next steps. While one obvious challenge for 
recommender systems is to produce accurate recommendations, a 
complimentary challenge is to rank recommendations based on their 
relevance. In this paper, we address this challenge for recommendation 
systems that are based on evolutionary coupling. Such systems use 
targeted association-rule mining to identify relevant patterns in a 
software system/'s change history. Traditionally, this process involves 
ranking artifacts using interestingness measures such as confidence and 
support. However, these measures often fall short when used to assess 
recommendation relevance. We propose the use of random forest 
classification models to assess recommendation relevance. This approach 
improves on past use of various interestingness measures by learning 
from previous change recommendations. We empirically evaluate our 
approach on fourteen open source systems and two systems from our 
industry partners. Furthermore, we consider complimenting two mining 
algorithms: CO-CHANGE and TARMAQ. The results find that random forest 
classification significantly outperforms previous approaches, receives 
lower Brier scores, and has superior trade-off between precision and 
recall. The results are consistent across software system and mining 
algorithm.

                Online appendix for paper /"Continuous Code Quality: Are
 We /(Really/) Doing That?/" by/&nbsp;Carmine Vassallo, Fabio Palomba, 
Alberto Bacchelli, Harald C. Gall. The paper will appear in the 
proceedings of the 33rd IEEE//ACM International Conference on Automated 
Software Engineering /(ASE/),/&nbsp;Montpellier, France, 
2018.Abstract./&nbsp;Continuous Integration /(CI/) is a software 
engineering practice where developers constantly integrate their changes
 to a project through an automated build process. The goal of CI is to 
provide developers with prompt feedback on several quality dimensions 
after each change. Indeed, previous studies provided empirical evidence 
on a/&nbsp;positive association between properly following CI principles
 and source code quality. A core principle behind CI is Continuous Code 
Quality /(also known as CCQ, which includes automated testing and 
automated code inspection/) may appear simple and effective, yet we know
 little about its practical adoption. In this paper, we propose a 
preliminary empirical investigation aimed at understanding 
how/&nbsp;rigorously/&nbsp;practitioners follow CCQ. Our study reveals 
a/&nbsp;strong/&nbsp;dichotomy between theory and practice: developers 
do not perform continuous inspection but rather control for quality only
 at the end of a sprint and most of the times only on the release 
branch.

âMore than 60/% of the errors in a software product are committed during
 the design and less than 40/% during coding.â/[1/] and âFinding and 
fixing a software problem after delivery is often 100 times more 
expensive than finding and fixing it during the requirements and design 
phaseâ /[2/]. So finding defects in an early stage of software 
development is of great importance.Use cases are widely used in 
Model-Driven Development to capture user requirements. Since the 
majority part of a use case document is written in natural language, it 
is thus highly desirable to rely on advanced natural language processing
 techniques to automatic the procedure of defects detection in use case 
documents.Natural Language ParserZpar is a statistical muti-language 
parser. It has the state-of-the-art speed and accuracy for both Chinese 
and English on standard Penn Treebank data. Zpar provides word 
segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and phrase 
structure parsing functionalities.Use Case Defect Finder /(UCDF/)We 
developed a tool /(UCDF/) to automatically analysis use case documents 
and find defects. The source code is available here.Input Use Case 
DocumentsWe tested UCDF on two use case documents /(for real systems/). 
One is a stock trading system and the other is a personalized health 
informatics system for a reference implementation for 
IEEEP2407-compliant system. The stock trading system is in real use, 
thus the specifications of the system are confidential. We release the 
use case document for the personalized health informatics system, the 
automated guided vehicle system, the emergency monitoring system and the
 online shopping system.Paper AbstractUse cases, as the primary 
techniques in the user requirement analysis, have been widely adopted in
 the requirement engineering practice. As developed early, use cases 
also serve as the basis for function requirement development, system 
design and testing. Errors in the use cases could potentially lead to 
problems in the system design or implementation. It is thus highly 
desirable to detect errors in use cases. Automatically analyzing use 
case documents is challenging primarily because they are written in 
natural languages. In this work, we aim to achieve automatic defect 
detection in use case documents by leveraging on advanced parsing 
techniques. In our approach, we first parse the use case document using 
dependency parsing techniques. The parsing results of each use case are 
further processed to form an activity diagram. Lastly, we perform defect
 detection on the activity diagrams. To evaluate our approach, we have 
conducted experiments on 200+ real-world as well as academic use cases. 
The results show the effectiveness of our method.
