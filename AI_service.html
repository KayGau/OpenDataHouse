          Motivation: AI, especially deep learning, is very popular in research area and job market. Many researches and studies devote to developing new
          neural network architectures and to making AI application development easier. However, there is little knowledge about
          the whole AI application world, for example: What kind of AI applications do people build? Here, we attempt to reveal the
          structure of AI application world.<br /> <br />
          Aim: We want to set up reasonable categories manually. Then, we want to develop automatic methods (supervised or unsupervised)
          to classify all AI projects into appropriate categories. If possible, we also want to assign a date (year, for example)
          to each AI project to discover the trend of AI application domains.<br /> <br />
          First exploration: We first make some explorations on tensorflow projects on WoC, which is an infrastructure for mining the universe
          of open source VCS data. <br />
          We first filter out all python files on WoC that contain word 'tensorflow' which a tensorflow project must contain. Then, by utilizing 
          the blob-to-commit map and commit-to-project map provided by WoC, we recognize 231,867 tensorflow projects. Beacause finding all 
          tensorflow commits and tensorflow projects takes a long time, we first randomly select 100 tensorflow blobs, find all projects that 
          contain them and get 1,291 projects. We then manually check these projects and classify them. We exclude those projects that are not on 
          github (for the convenience to access their homepage) and are forked from other projects (by github label). Finally, we get 331 projetcs.
          So, there are many forks in the dataset and we should exclude them in the later research. <br />
          We then manually check the 331 projects and double check our results. And we first classify them into 3 big categories. They are cloned 
          projects, customize projects and self-developed projects. Cloned projects just like fork, but they are not labelled as fork. Customize 
          projects modify slightly other projects. Self-developed projects are totally developed by the user.<br />

          <br />
          Although we have excluded forked projects, there are also many cloned
          projects. Concretely, there are 136 projects that are cloned from tensorflow main repository, 4 projects that are cloned from edward repository, 
          a probabilistic programming language, 2 projects that are cloned from libspn, a learning and infernce library with Sum-product Networks, 3 
          projects that are clone from keras, antoher popular machine learning library built on tensorflow.
          <table class="table">
            <caption class="text-center">clone projects</caption>
             <tbody>
                <tr>
                   <td>cloned from</td>
                   <td>tensorflow</td>
                   <td>edward</td>
                   <td>keras</td>
                   <td>libspn</td>
                   <td>sum</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                   <td>number</td>
                   <td>136</td>
                   <td>4</td>
                   <td>3</td>

                </tr>
             </tbody>
          </table>

          Besides, there are 42 blog back up projects that contain the same tensorflow files. In addition, there are also some project that slightly modify 
          other projects. In detail, there are 43 projects that customize tensorflow to make it run on android, ios and other platforms, 5 projects that slightly 
          modify google's seq2seq, a powerful NLP model.
          <table class="table">
            <caption class="text-center">customize projects</caption>
             <tbody>
                <tr>
                   <td>original project</td>
                   <td>blog files</td>
                   <td>tensorflow</td>
                   <td>seq2seq</td>
                   <td>sum</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                   <td>number</td>
                   <td>42</td>
                   <td>43</td>
                   <td>5</td>
                   <td>90</td>
                </tr>
             </tbody>
          </table>
          After excluding cloned and customize projects, there are 96 self-developed projects remained. We set 10 categories, they are: 
          Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Reinforcement Learning (RL), BIOINFORMATICS (BIO), DATASET, DATA ANALYSIS (DA), COURSE, 
          TUTORIAL, RESEARCH (RES) and OTHER. CV & NLP are areas deep learning techniques are widely applied in. RL is a field that is juxtaposed with deep
          learning and gains more and more attention in recent years. It includes game AI, self-driving and so on. BIO including medical and health applications, is another area 
          that AI techniques can be used. Dataset are repositories containing public datasets and scripts for using them. DA are repositories about structural
          data analysis. Here, image, video and text are unstructural data. Structural data analysis including movie recommendation and so on. Course are repositories 
          about popular public courses such as cs224n and udacity. Tutorial are repositories about learning AI techniques, including code examples, docs and so on.
          RES are repositories about paper recurring. Other are repositories that can not be classified into the above, such as libraries.

          Result analysis: Through our manually checked result, we can see:
          <ul>
            <li style="text-align: left">There are still many cloned projects after excluding thoses labelled forked projects.</li>
            <li style="text-align: left">Some projects contain the same tensorflow files, such as those 42 blog back up projects.</li>
            <li style="text-align: left">CV, NLP, RL and tutorial projects dominate self-developed projects. So many tutorial projects
            indicate that AI is very popular.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lead text-muted" style="font-size: 19px; text-align: left; margin-top:20px">
          Next plan:
          <ul>
            <li style="text-align: left">Finding out all AI projects based on popular AI frameworks.</li>
            <li style="text-align: left">Manually checking gives us an insight that there are many forked, cloned and slight customized
            projects which should be excluded. We can identify cloned projects by judging whether they share a same commit. But for small
            customize projects, we now think of judging whether they share most of their blobs. </li>
