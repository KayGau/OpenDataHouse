                Cascading Style Sheets /(CSS/) is a language used for 
describing the look and formatting of HTML documents. CSS has been 
widely adopted in web and mobile development practice, since it enables a
 clean separation of content from presentation. The language exhibits 
complex features, such as inheritance, cascading and specificity, which 
make CSS code hard to maintain. Therefore, it is important to find ways 
to improve the maintainability of CSS code. In this paper, we propose an
 automated approach to remove duplication in CSS code. More 
specifically, we have developed a technique that detects three types of 
CSS declaration duplication and recommends refactoring opportunities to 
eliminate those duplications. Our approach uses preconditions that 
ensure the application of a refactoring will preserve the original 
document styling. We evaluate our technique on 38 real-world web systems
 and 91 CSS files, in total. Our findings show that duplication in CSS 
code is widely prevalent. Additionally, there is a significant number of
 presentation-preserving refactoring opportunities that can reduce the 
size of the CSS files and increase the maintainability of the code.

                Sketches and diagrams play an important role in the 
daily work of software developers. In our paper "Sketches and Diagrams 
in Practice" we present the results of our research on the usage of 
sketches and diagrams in software engineering practice. We focused 
especially on their relation to the core elements of a software project,
 the source code artifacts. Furthermore, we wanted to assess how helpful
 sketches are for understanding the related source code. We intended to 
find out if, how, and why sketches and diagrams are archived and are 
thereby available for future use. Software is created with and for a 
wide range of stakeholders. Since sketches are often a means for 
communicating between these stakeholders, we were not only interested in
 sketches and diagrams created by software developers, but by all 
software practitioners, including testers, architects, project managers,
 as well as researchers and consultants. In a survey with 394 software 
‘practitioners’, we mainly asked questions about the the last sketch or 
diagram that they had created. Contrary to our expectations and previous
 work, the majority of sketches and diagrams contained at least some UML
 elements. However, most of them were informal. The most common purposes
 for creating sketches and diagrams were designing, explaining, and 
understanding, but analyzing requirements was also named often. More 
than half of the sketches and diagrams were created on analog media like
 paper or whiteboards and have been revised after creation. Most of them
 were used for more than a week and were archived. About half of the 
sketches were rated as helpful to understand the related source code 
artifact/(s/) in the future. Our study complements a number of existing 
studies on the use of sketches and diagrams in software development, 
which analyzed the above aspects only in parts and often focused on an 
academic environment, a single company, open source projects, or were 
limited to a small group of participants.The questionnaire for the 
online survey was online from August 28, 2013 until December 31, 2013. 
Further information on our research design and research questions can be
 found in the referenced paper. This dataset contains the questionnaire,
 the data we collected during this survey, and a basic R script that can
 be used as a starting point for validating our results and further 
exploring the data. This data set has been reviewed and accepted by the 
Artifact Evaluation Committee of FSE 2014. Since we assured our 
participants that their data is handled confidentially, only the 
quantitative data is directly available here. If you are also interested
 in the qualitative data from our survey, don’t hesitate to contact the

 /"/" to SASO 19:Many approaches apply optimization techniques in SASs, 
mostly within the planning procedure, to generate new system 
configurations or adaptation plans. We performed an analysis of these 
techniques based on approaches published during the last ten years in 
conferences and journals related to self-adaptive systems /(SASs/), 
namely ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive System /(TAAS/), the 
International Conference on Autonomic/&nbsp;Computing and Communications
 /(ICAC/), the International Conferences on Self-Adaptive and 
Self-Organizing Systems /(SASO/), the International Symposium on 
Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems /(SEAMS/), 
and the Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering /(FSE/). We
 identified the use of 29 different techniques in 51 publications. This 
list shows that a large set of techniques from different classes such as
 probabilistic, combinatorial, evolutionary, stochastic, mathematical, 
and meta-heuristic optimization are applied in SASs./&nbsp;We provide

                We present a large-scale and long-term dataset that can 
be used to examine community-level spatial variation in phenological 
dynamics and its climatic drivers. The database consists of 510,165 
observation dates collected in 472 localities in the Russian Federation,
 Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan /(Fig. 1/) over a 129-year 
period /(from 1890 to 2018/). During this period, researchers 
intensively conducted regular observations to record dates at which a 
predefined list of phenological and climatic events /(Table 1/) 
occurred. Although 96/% of the observations were acquired from 1960 
onwards, a few time series are very long. Events measured for plants 
include e.g. the onset days of leaf unfolding, first flowering time, and
 leaf fall; for birds they include e.g. days for first spring and last 
autumn occurrences; for insects, amphibians, reptiles and fungi they 
include e.g. day of first occurrence in the spring. The plant data were 
acquired in fixed plots, and the bird data along established routes. 
Climatic events were recorded as calendar dates when those events took 
place. Of all phenological dates, 88/% were collected by research 
personnel of nature protected areas and national parks, who followed a 
systematic protocol. Thus, sampling effort remained nearly constant over
 time. The remaining 12/% of the observations came from a 
well-established volunteer phenological network of volunteers, who 
followed a similar systematic protocol.The recording scheme implemented 
at nature reserves offers unique opportunities for addressing 
community-level change across replicate local communities. These data 
have been systematically collected not as independent monitoring 
efforts, but using a shared and carefully standardized protocol adapted 
for each local community. Thus, variability in observation effort is of 
much less concern than in most other distributed cross-taxon 
phenological monitoring schemes. To enable analyses of higher-level 
taxonomical groups, we have included taxonomic classifications for the 
species in the database.The compilation of the data into a common 
database was conducted by the database coordinators /(EM and CL/) in 
Helsinki /(Finland/). Those participants that already held the data in 
digital format submitted it in the original format, and those that had 
the data only in paper format digitized it using Excel-based templates 
developed in the project meetings. Submitted data were processed by the 
database coordinators according to the following steps:/&nbsp; The data 
were formatted so that each observation /(the phenological date of a 
particular event in a particular locality and year/) formed one row in 
the data table /(e.g. un-pivoting tables that involved several years as 
the columns/). The phenological event names were split into event type 
/(e.g. /“first occurrence/“/) and species name. The event type names 
/(provided originally typically in Russian/) were translated into 
English and the species names /(usually provided in Russian/) were 
identified to scientific names, using dictionaries that were partly 
developed and verified in the project meetings. All scientific names 
were periodically verified by mapping them to the Global Biodiversity 
Information Facility /(GBIF/) backbone taxonomy25. We associated each 
data record with the following set of information fields: /(1/) project 
name, i.e. the source organization, /(2/) dataset name, /(3/) locality 
name, /(4/) unique taxon identifier, /(5/) scientific taxon name, and 
/(6/) event type. We imported the data records in the main database 
/(maintained as an EarthCape database at https:////ecn.ecdb.io/). During
 the import, the taxonomic names, locality names, and dataset names were
 matched against already existing records.The database is organized in 
six datasets: /(A/) a classification of taxa included; /(B/) a 
classification of climatic events included; /(C/) information on the 
study sites; /(D/) the phenology data, /(E/) an information sources 
table for classification data, and /(F/) an information sources table 
for phenology data. All tables are in csv format /(columns separated by 
comas/) /(Data Citation 1/). The tables can be linked to each other 
using the unique study site names and the unique identifiers for species
 and climatic evens. The taxonomy table has twelve columns: /(1/) the 
unique identifier of the taxon, /(2/) the scientific name of the taxon, 
/(3/) the highest taxonomical level to which the taxon is described, 
/(4/) kingdom, /(5/) phylum, /(6/) class, /(7/) order, /(8/) family, 
/(9/) genus, /(10/) species, /(11/) The GBIF key for the taxon, and 
/(12/) the GBIF status of the taxon. The climatic events table has two 
columns: /(1/) the type of the climatic event, /(2/) the type of the 
climatic event /(e.g. related to temperature, snow or ice/). The study 
sites table has three columns: /(1/) the name of the study site, /(2/) 
latitude, /(3/) longitude. The phenology table has nine columns: /(1/) 
the name of the project in which the data were collected /(2/) the name 
of the dataset to which the data belongs to, /(3/) the name of the study
 site in which the data were collected, /(4/) the unique identifier of 
the taxon /(/“Climate/” for climatic events/), /(5/) the scientific name
 of taxon /(climatic group for climatic events/), /(6/) the type of the 
event, /(7/) the year, /(8/) the date of the observation as the number 
of days since January 1st in the focal year, and /(9/) a column 
indicating if any quality issues were identified with the data. The 
information sources table for phenology data has three columns: /(1/) 
the name of the project, /(2/) the type of information sources /(mostly 
Chronicles of Nature Books of the participating organizations/) /(3/) 
the references used to extract the phenology data.
